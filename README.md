This theme is designed to be useful, not pretty.
I measure usability based on how quickly you can determine what you're looking at.
Currently supports different styles for `php`, `html`, `css`, `js`.

The amount of colors is minimal, and each has a specific role:
- Yellow: functions & classes
- Orange: variables / storage
- Green: string
- Red: constant
